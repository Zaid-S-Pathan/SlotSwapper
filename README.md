## 1. General Information

🎯 Project Overview

SlotSwapper is a collaborative time-management platform that enables users to exchange their scheduled time slots effortlessly. Instead of rescheduling manually, users can mark specific calendar events as available for swap, explore others’ swappable slots, and seamlessly trade times that better fit their day — all within a few clicks.

💡 How It Works

- **Mark Availability** – A user flags one of their events (for example, “Client Review” from 10:00–11:00 AM Tuesday) as Swappable.
- **Discover Matches** – The user browses a shared marketplace displaying other users’ available swappable slots.
- **Request Swap** – They find a suitable slot (e.g., another user’s Focus Session on Wednesday 2:00–3:00 PM) and send a swap request.
- **Accept or Decline** – The recipient receives a notification and can accept or reject the request.
- **Automatic Update** – Upon acceptance, both users’ schedules are instantly updated with the new event times — no confusion, no overlap.

### Marketplace

The Marketplace is the central place to discover slots other users have marked as swappable. It's designed to make matching and requesting swaps fast and clear.

- Browse a live list of swappable slots from other users.
- Filter by date, time range, owner, or status to quickly find suitable matches.
- Click any slot to open a detail view with the full event title, owner, time window, and any notes.
- When you find a match, click "Request Swap", pick which of your own swappable slots to offer, and send the request.
- Requests the recipient sees will appear in their Requests view where they can Accept or Decline. Status updates (PENDING → ACCEPTED / REJECTED) are shown in both users' dashboards.

## 8. Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas and planned improvements for SlotSwapper. These are optional features that would enhance usability, reliability, and collaboration:

- Notifications
   - Push / email notifications for incoming swap requests and responses.
   - In-app notification center with read/unread state.

- Calendar Integrations
   - Two-way sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCal so accepted swaps update external calendars.

- Search & Filters
   - Advanced filtering (duration, tags, location, time zone) and saved searches.

- Analytics & Audit
   - Admin dashboard with swap activity, user growth, and audit logs for swaps.

- Performance & Scaling
   - Background jobs for heavy tasks (notifications, analytics) and a scalable deployment setup (worker queues, caching).

- Security & Privacy
   - Rate limiting, stricter validation, and privacy controls for who can see swappable slots.

- UX Improvements
   - Guided onboarding, tooltips, and improved error messages to reduce friction.
